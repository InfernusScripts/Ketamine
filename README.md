## What is it?
- A fresh Roblox Remote Spy (not really, it supports more than that) with modern UI that you can (kinda) customise
### - Supports:
- `Remote Spy` - log outcoming & incoming requests; can hook outcoming arguments
- `Bindable Spy` (Event Spy) - log BindableEvents & BindableFunctions; can kinda hook arguments
- `HTTP Spy` - log every (I hope) HTTP request that executor does
- `Script Scanner` - allows you to search scripts by keywords, very useful for finding anticheats or init scripts
- `Memory Scanner` - mega tool to detect game's frameworks (but laggy as hell)

- More stuff coming soon
